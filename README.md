This repository showcases an assembly implementation of a 5-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using the mycpu module. It initializes memory with coefficients and input data, executes the FIR algorithm, and validates the output against expected results, confirming the functionality and accuracy of the mycpu module.
